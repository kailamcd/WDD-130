        <h2>Kaila McDonald</h2>
        <p>I'm Kaila, an aspiring Marriage and Family Therapist.</p>
        <p>My full-time job is parenting three amazing kids, ages 8, 5, and 1.</p>
        <p>I am a fitness enthusiast. I took part in a bikini competition in 2017 and took home 3rd place in my division!</p>
        <p>I'm not employed right now, but I'm hoping to find a remote job in web programming that will allow me to be at home with my babies while earning an income.</p>
        <p>To serve my goals, I am pursuing a Professional Studies degree with certificates in Web and Computer Programming and Marriage and Family Systems.</p>
        <p>I see a big advantage in the opportunities for remote work associated with programming jobs. I also intend to have a private practice one day, and being able to build my own website or fix errors on one will cut some of the start up costs down.
            I also know that having professional certificates in programming will allow me to find better employment, faster, so that I can pay my way through school.
        </p>
        <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints all my life. It has become more valuable and precious to me as I have grown and experienced the pains of mortal life. I am very grateful for President Nelson and you'll frequently find me listening to his conference addresses. I couldn't possibly pick just one favorite quote, but "Spiritual Treasures" is one of my favorite talks ever.</p>
