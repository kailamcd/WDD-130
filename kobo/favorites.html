              <p class="info-heart">There have been few skills more powerful in my life than being able to name my emotions. I love language and the power it has to communicate complex ideas between people. Why do we so often say we are feeling "sad" or "happy" or "angry" when what we're going through is so much more particular than that. Isn't grieving so different from disappointed? Isn't joyful different from content? You'll learn eighty-seven different emotion definitions and names. <br>
    <br>
                Brene Brown, a Social Worker, Doctor of Philosophy and Professor at the University of Texas, breaks down years of research in this book about what our emotions are and what we call them. <br>
    <br>
                There is a profound connection available to those who do the work to know their inner-selves. If you are looking for a place to start on that journey, Atlas of the Heart is a beautiful beginning.<br>

              <img class="cover-art" alt="cover of How to Avoid Falling in Love with a Jerk" src="images/how-to-avoid.jpg">

              <p class="info-jerk">Though this book has what I would call a 'sensational' title, it really is a look at how to recognize and build healthy relationships. We have all been in relationships we thought were going well, only to find ourselves feeling frustrated, lonely, or even used. This book lays out a five step process to building a lasting relationship, but the same five steps also help you weed out partners early who are not what you're looking for.<br>
                <br>
          John Van Epp has a PhD in Counseling/Psychology and 25 years of clinical experience. He also has a background in Theology which informs some of the research-proven tips in this book.
          <br>
          <br>
          If you're in or want to be in a romantic relationship, this book gives a framework to create a healthy, respectful, lasting relationship. Fair warning, the narrator of this audiobook has a very smarmy voice that was a little distracting during my first listen, but the content is well worth sticking around.
