      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>kobo&copy; is all about helping people help themselves.<br>
        Have you ever searched a self-help book topic only to find yourself overwhelmed by the hundreds of options? Which of these authors is the most qualified? Which of these books applies to your specific relationship status or goals? Which of them is most well researched?<br>
        Before you panic-buy the one with the catchiest title or, worse, abandon your pursuit of knowledge altogether, kobo&copy; is here to help.<br>
        At kobo&copy; we review books by only the most well-respected and well-researched experts, then curate them into collections so you can find the most relevant and helpful information possible.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The kobo audience are driven self-improvers. They are thoughtful and particular. Usually in their late 20s to early 40s, kobo customers are generally professionals and in or interested in long-term relationships. They will most likely choose to listen to an audiobook rather than pick up a physical book because they are busy.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>About</h3>
        <h4>About kobo&copy;:</h4>
        <p>Lemme tell you two things I genuinely love: <br>
        Books. Therapy. <br>
        Heaven knows I love a physical book.
        But - my life doesn't facilitate a lot of sit-down-and-busy-both-hands-and-your-mind-with-single-minded-focus activities, you feel me? <br>
        And, man, do I love in-person therapy. But - some weeks I'd be getting every single day sessions and draining the annual budget in a single month, you know? <br>
        The solution (bibliotherapy, or books that teach theraputic techniques, via audiobook) comes with its own struggles though, doesn't it? <br>
        There are thousands of options, how do you know which one will help you? <br>
        Well, that's why kobo&copy; exists! kobo&copy; is a curated collection of the best, most authoritative books for your different relationships, mental needs, and personal goals. Rather than ask you to read the synopsis and familiarize yourself with every author's credentials, kobo&copy; lets you search for exactly what you're trying to improve from only the most reliable authors. <br>
        Whether you're in a romantic relationship, have a profession, are a parent, or if you're just a human who wants to do and be better, kobo&copy;can help!</p>
        <br><br>

        <h4>About Kaila:</h4>
        <p>Kaila is a thirty-something single mom with a really great - really expensive - therapist. She's obsessed with becoming her best self (her therapist often reminds her that she is human and might need to accept some weaknesses). <br>
        It took Kaila a while to embrace audiobooks. While she still tries to pick up physical books whenever she can, you'll often find her with one earbud in, listening to the latest and greatest in self-development. <br>
        She found out pretty early in her bibliotherapy journey that not all self-dev books are created equal. There were many that were three-quarters hashing and rehashing the author's successes and only one-quarter actionable principles. Even worse, some only provide a single good idea, stretched out over six hours of audio. These books drove Kaila crazy. You know the mugs that say "I survived another meeting that should have been an email"? Kaila would like one that says "I just read another book that should have been a blog post". <br>
        So, she created kobo&copy; hoping that people could skip the listens that are marketed well but don't deliver. <br>
        <br>
        From me, Kaila, let me tell you that I admire you. You're looking to better yourself and your environment. It's hard! But you're looking for answers and I know kobo&copy; can help you find them. I believe in you!</p>

        <h4>Here are some of our founder's favorite books for any listener:</h4>
          <h5>Atlas of the Heart<br>
            -Brene Brown
          </h5>
          <p>There have been few skills more powerful in my life than being able to name my emotions. I love language and the power it has to communicate complex ideas between people. Why do we so often say we are feeling "sad" or "happy" or "angry" when what we're going through is so much more particular than that. Isn't grieving so different from disappointed? Isn't joyful different from content? You'll learn eighty-seven different emotion definitions and names. <br>
<br>
            Brene Brown, a Social Worker, Doctor of Philosophy and Professor at the University of Texas, breaks down years of research in this book about what our emotions are and what we call them. <br>
<br>
            There is a profound connection available to those who do the work to know their inner-selves. If you are looking for a place to start on that journey, Atlas of the Heart is a beautiful beginning.<br>
          </p>
          <h5>How to Avoid Falling in Love with a Jerk<br>
          -John Van Epp</h5>
          <p>Though this book has what I would call a 'sensational' title, it really is a look at how to recognize and build healthy relationships. We have all been in relationships we thought were going well, only to find ourselves feeling frustrated, lonely, or even used. This book lays out a five step process to building a lasting relationship, but the same five steps also help you weed out partners early who are not what you're looking for.<br>
<br>
          John Van Epp has a PhD in Counseling/Psychology and 25 years of clinical experience. He also has a background in Theology which informs some of the research-proven tips in this book.
          <br>
          <br>
          If you're in or want to be in a romantic relationship, this book gives a framework to create a healthy, respectful, lasting relationship. Fair warning, the narrator of this audiobook has a very smarmy voice that was a little distracting during my first listen, but the content is well worth sticking around.
