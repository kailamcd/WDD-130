            <p>Lemme tell you two things I genuinely love: <br>
            Books. Therapy. <br><br>
            Heaven knows I love a physical book.<br>
            <img class="about-pic" src="images/library.jpg" alt="shelves of books"/>
            <!-- get image to sit on right side of page without -->

            But - my life doesn't facilitate a lot of sit-down-and-busy-both-hands-and-your-mind-with-single-minded-focus activities, you feel me? <br><br>
            And, man, do I love in-person therapy. <br>
            But - some weeks I'd be getting every single day sessions and draining the annual budget in a single month, you know? <br><br>
            The solution (bibliotherapy, or books that teach theraputic techniques, via audiobook) comes with its own struggles though, doesn't it? <br><br>
            There are thousands of options, how do you know which one will help you? <br>
            Well, that's why kobo&copy; exists! kobo&copy; is a curated collection of the best, most authoritative books for your different relationships, mental needs, and personal goals. Rather than ask you to read the synopsis and familiarize yourself with every author's credentials, kobo&copy; lets you search for exactly what you're trying to improve from only the most reliable authors. <br><br>
            Whether you're in a romantic relationship, have a profession, are a parent, or if you're just a human who wants to do and be better, kobo&copy;can help!</p>

        <h1>About Kaila:</h1>
        <div class="big-p">
        <p>Kaila is a thirty-something single mom with a really great - really expensive - therapist. She's obsessed with becoming her best self (her therapist often reminds her that she is human and might need to accept some weaknesses).
        <br>
        <img class="bio-pic" src="images/PXL_20220528_214814352.PORTRAIT.jpg" alt="Kaila"/>
        <br>
        It took Kaila a while to embrace audiobooks. While she still tries to pick up physical books whenever she can, you'll often find her with one earbud in, listening to the latest and greatest in self-development. <br><br>
        She found out pretty early in her bibliotherapy journey that not all self-dev books are created equal. There were many that were three-quarters hashing and rehashing the author's successes and only one-quarter actionable principles. Even worse, some only provide a single good idea, stretched out over six hours of audio. These books drove Kaila crazy. You know the mugs that say "I survived another meeting that should have been an email"? Kaila would like one that says "I just read another book that should have been a blog post". <br><br>
        So, she created kobo&copy; hoping that people could skip the listens that are marketed well but don't deliver. <br>
        <br>
        From me, Kaila, let me tell you that I admire you. You're looking to better yourself and your environment. It's hard! But you're looking for answers and I know kobo&copy; can help you find them. I believe in you!</p>
